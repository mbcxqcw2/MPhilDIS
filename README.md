## Introduction

Welcome to Lecture 10 of your A1 minor module: Data Driven Radio Astronomy in the SKA Era This lecture serves as a practical follow-up to Lecture 9: Time Domain Astronomy (from baseband to discovery).

During this lecture, we will walk through the process of analysing a common type of time domain radio astronomy data. Starting with a simulated dynamic spectrum, we will develop practical experience in RFI mitigation, and dedispersion, and eventually identify which pulsar this dataset belongs to.
