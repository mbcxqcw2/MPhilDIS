## Introduction

Welcome to Lecture 10 of your A1 minor module: Data Driven Radio Astronomy in the SKA Era This lecture serves as a practical follow-up to Lecture 9: Time Domain Astronomy (from baseband to discovery).

During this lecture, we will walk through the process of analysing a common type of time domain radio astronomy data. Starting with a simulated dynamic spectrum, we will develop practical experience in RFI mitigation, and dedispersion, and eventually identify which pulsar this dataset belongs to.

## Resources

### Option 1 (preferred): Use Binder

You can access the notebook containing an example exercise which leaves gaps for you to do your own coding using the Binder link here: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mbcxqcw2/MPhilDIS/main?urlpath=%2Fdoc%2Ftree%2F%2Fnotebooks%2FMPhil_DIS_A1_L10_Incomplete.ipynb)

Please attempt to do this on your own to the best of your ability. If you get stuck, a full worked example can be found below.

### Option 2 (alternative): Use Google Colab

Alternatively, click [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1IbsblCQgtRA_PaqZ-uA1qg7ye3IBrhoB?usp=sharing)  to access a Google Colab notebook for this lecture. Once you have been granted access to this notebook, please save a copy of it to your drive and ONLY MODIFY THE COPY! Otherwise all students will end up modifying the same file.

Please attempt to do this on your own to the best of your ability. If you get stuck, a full worked example can be found below.
