        "Now consider what radio astronomers must do when searching for brand new signals during observational surveys. These surveys are carried out over hundreds of hours, and sample vast portions of the sky which may, or may not contain signals of interest. As we do not have any prior knowledge about what the DM of a signal we observe might be, astronomers must search over a large DM range. In addition, not all RFI looks the same, and so algorithms and techniques for RFI removal must be adaptable to different situations.\n",

        "As radio observatories become more and more ambitious, high-performance computing, parallel processing, and machine learning will become ever more essential if we want to make the most of the huge amounts of data that we will collect. Data-intensive science is a vital skill to maximise the scientific return from projects like the SKA.\n",
